### Variables
* eligible characters are 'A–Z', 'a–z', '_', '$', But '$' is not suggested use, as *It is intended for names that are generated by the **Java compiler** and other tools*.

```java
int i;
System.out.println(i); // ERROR- variable NOT initialized
```

* variables can be used a constants by prefixing `final` keyword, then value will be assigned only once and will not be modified
* Generally, keywords would be used CAPITAL letters for variable
* If the constant is across multiple objects, we could use `static` which be one for multiple objects
